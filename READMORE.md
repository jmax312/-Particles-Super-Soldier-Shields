##Super Soldier Shields

This app uses two particle classes to create a mini game in which the user uses constantly spawning images of Captain America's shield to erase Hydra logos which are taking over the screen. To use, start the app and then just drag the mouse over any Hydra logo you wish to destroy. The shields will follow your mouse. 

NB: There is currently no win or lose state, so you may play the game as long as you like.
